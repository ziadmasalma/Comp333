This project was for data base, we did it as a group, and we divided the work among ourselves. The project is a simple sales system for a small shop or butcher shop. The program has many interfaces that make it easier for the user to deal with it
The users of the project are the storeâ€™s employees and customers. The customer selects the goods to be purchased, and the application creates the invoice for him and adds it to the invoices, which he continuously prepares reports about to clarify to the business owner the sales details during a specific period of time that he chooses.
My role in this project was to prepare data lists, link the program to it, and prepare sql codes that prepare reports for the employer, through which you can add new items to the program and add employees
